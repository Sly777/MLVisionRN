  - `bundle install` to install the necessary gems.
  - `bundle exec pod install` to install the required pods.
- Return to the root directory and enter the `ios` folder, repeating the steps above.
- Once again, return to the root directory and run `yarn visionos` and/or `yarn ios` to build and install the applications.
- After the application has been built, execute `yarn start` to launch the metro server in a separate terminal window.
